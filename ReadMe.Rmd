I have set up 3 folders for this project:

**Supply**\
This folder contains the files necessary for automating the Santa Rosa
Plains (SRP) GS Flow and PRMS (Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System)
hydrology models. As of `r Sys.Date()` has 5 subfolders. The
pre-processing and post-processing of the *PRMS* model has been nearly
entirely automated. By contrast, much of the *SRP GS Flow* model still
needs to be automated.

-   *Documentation:* This folder contains relevant emails, PDFs, Word
    Documents and other files containing instructions or information
    about the project.

-   *InputData:* This folder contains the datasets used for loops and
    functions, e.g. station lists. Maintaining these datasets as CSVs is
    easier than creating then as dataframes.

-   *ProcessedData:* This folder contains datasets that have been
    manipulated in some way by R Scripts, spreadsheets, etc.

-   *Scripts:* This folder contains all scripts associated with this
    project

-   *WebData:* This folder contains unaltered datasets scraped or
    downloaded from the Internet, e.g. weather station data

**Demand**\
This folder contains the files necessary for converting the raw diverter
demand data from eWRIMS into a processed, QAQC'd demand dataset ready
for importation into DWRAT. As of `r Sys.Date()`, this folder has 4
subfolders, which just contain placeholder scripts--the actual scripts
have yet to be written.

-   *Documentation*: This folder will contain relevant emails, PDFs,
    Word Documents and other files containing instructions or
    information about the project.

-   *InputData* This folder will contain the raw diverter demand
    datasets from eWRIMS.

-   *ProcessedData:* This folder will contain datasets that have been
    manipulated in some way by R Scripts, spreadsheets, etc.

-   *OutputData*: This folder will contain the final demand dataset CSVs
    that are ready for importation to the Upper Russian River (URR) and
    Lower Russian River (LRR) Drought Water Rights Allocation (DWRAT)
    models.

-   *Scripts*: This folder will contain the scripts that convert the raw
    diverter demand datasets into the final datasets to be used by the
    DWRAT models.

**Allocation**\
This folder will contain the files necessary for running the URR and LRR
DWRATs, each of which will have a separate folder.

-   ***URR DWRAT***
    -   *Input**:*** This folder contains the input files for the URR
        DWRAT run.
    -   *Output:* This folder contains the output files for the URR
        DWRAT run.
-   ***LRR DWRAT***
    -   *Input:* This folder contains the input files for the LRR DWRAT
        run.
    -   *Output:* This folder contains the output files for the URR
        DWRAT run.
