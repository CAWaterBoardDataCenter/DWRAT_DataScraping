I have set up 5 folders for this project:

* **Documentation:**
This folder contains all relevant emails, PDFs, Word Documents and other files containing instructions or information about the project.

* **InputData:**
This folder contains the datasets used for loops and functions, e.g. station lists. Maintaining these datasets as CSVs is easier than creating then as dataframes.

* **ProcessedData:** 
This folder contains datasets that have been manipulated in some way by R Scripts, spreadsheets, etc.

* **Scripts:** 
This folder contains all scripts associated with this project

* **WebData:** 
This folder contains unaltered datasets scraped or downloaded from the Internet, e.g. weather station data
