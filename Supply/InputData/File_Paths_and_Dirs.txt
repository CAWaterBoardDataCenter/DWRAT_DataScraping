Please keep the file paths on the same lines as their labels!
example - Path description:   (Some spaces, at least three)   Your file path!


! Important !
This file will eventually be condensed into a couple of file paths
	My plan is to first map out all of the filepath dependencies required for running the models
	Then I'll write a "pre-check" script that would run at the beginning of the master script 
	It would verify that all of these file paths exist and are valid
	With that script present, this file would need fewer file paths (mainly "path to RR_PRMS" and "path to Github repository")
	Some cases like the link to the .jar file and .dat file may still need their paths specified (unless I write some additional functions to handle unusual cases)


============= Paths for "Downsizer_Assistant_Noninteractive.R" =============

(1) Path to downsizer client executable (the .jar file):        C:\RR_PRMS\PRMS\input\data_file_prep\downsizer_raw_data\downsizer-client-64bit-3.2.4.jar


(2) Path to the downsizer station CSV (downsizer_sta.csv):      C:\RR_PRMS\PRMS\input\data_file_prep\downsizer_raw_data\downsizer_sta.csv


(3) Path to the "WebData" folder in your GitHub repository (no specific file for this one):     C:\Users\aprashar\Documents\Github\DWRAT_DataScraping\Supply\WebData


============= Paths for "PRMS_Model_Execution.R" =============

(1) Path to the "RR_PRMS" folder:           C:\RR_PRMS


(2) Path to your source .dat file:         C:\RR_PRMS\PRMS\input\climate_scenarios\data_update_to_2023-03-28.dat
		Note: The script will NOT overwrite this file. It will create a copy and append the output data from "DAT_File_Manipulation.R" to it


(3) Path to "prms_rr.control" file:     C:\RR_PRMS\windows\prms_rr.control


(4) Path to "gsflow.exe":    C:\RR_PRMS\bin\gsflow.exe


(5) Path to the PRMS "output" folder:          C:\RR_PRMS\PRMS\output


(6) Path to the "run" batch file:       C:\RR_PRMS\windows\run.bat
