I created this text file to list all the SharePoint URLs for relevant Office files (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX) 
pertaining to documentation and workflow for the DWRAT_DataScraping repository. Maintaining Office files
on GitHub is inefficient, tedious, and mistake-prone, and horrible for sharing on Teams. But I want to maintain 
a list of the URLS in this text file so that our coders have quick access to relevant context.
