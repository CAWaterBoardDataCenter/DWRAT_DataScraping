```

-   Which script creates **RR_POD_Subbasin_Assignment.xlsx?** It is created by **Assign_Subbasin_to_POD.R**.

-   Which sheet in the spreadsheet should we import? Right now the MasterDemandTable.R script doesn't specify, but it should be amended to point to the **PODTable** sheet.

-   What library in R houses read_xlsx? *library(readxl)*

```{r}
library(readxl)
getwd()
podDf <- read_xlsx(path = "OutputData/RR_POD_Subbasin_Assignment.xlsx", sheet = "POD_Table",)
```
